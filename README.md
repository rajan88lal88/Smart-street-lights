# Smart-street-lights
Automatic street lights that will light up when there is a passer by or a car nearby.

On a Highways that are too isolated or the resident ares with few people, the remain On all the time wasting a lot of electricity. These light only turn on when the detect and obstacle/motion on the path ie the light will remain ON even if the passer or the car stops and remain on the road. This can be advantageous for the law inforcemnts and emmergency vehicles and a lighted spot in Dark is much more noticeable than the dark spot in light.

This project uses IR sensors ( I know that there som more practical and better alternatives like Ultrasonic ), Arduino microcontroller, and LEDs(street Lights).
